How to contribute?
Did you find a bug?
Ensure the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub under Project Issues.

Please avoid opening issues asking to be "assigned” to a particular algorithm. This merely creates unnecessary noise for maintainers. Instead, please submit your implementation in a pull request and it will be evaluated by project maintainers.

If you are unable to find an open issue refering to the same problem, depending on the type of issue follow the appropriate steps:

Do you want to contribute to the documentation?
Please read the documentation in here Contributing to the Documentation ,open a new one issue, make changes and then create a pull request, it will be put under review and accepted if it is approprite.
Do you want to add a new feature?
Open a new one issue. Be sure to include a title and a clear description and a test case demonstrating the new feature that you want to add to the project.
Do you want to fix a bug?
Open a new one issue.Be sure to include a title and a clear description and a test case demonstrating the expected behaviour that is not occuring.
